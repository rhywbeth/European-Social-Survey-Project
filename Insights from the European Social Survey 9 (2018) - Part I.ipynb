    "This project uses the data collected in 2018/2019 during the 9th European Social Survey, which you can find here: [ESS9](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/about/singlenew.html?a=/about/news/essnews0076.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically driven cross-national survey that has been conducted across Europe since its establishment in 2001. Every two years, face-to-face interviews are conducted with newly selected, cross-sectional samples.\n",
    "The survey measures the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of diverse populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data from the 2018 survey compared to the previous 2016 survey is significantly smaller in size, with over 8k fewer entries. The ESS9 is around 80% of entries from ESS8. The documentation of the survey reveals that there is a difference in participants. Iceland, Israel, Lithuania, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and Sweden are not considered. Which is interesting as the feature country being Russia came as one of the important ones in the previous analysis of the happiness factor, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pascalbliem/insights-from-the-european-social-survey-8). But we also get new countries in the survey, such as Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Serbia. 7 out, 3 in. \n",
    "It is worth to note that this is the 1.0 edition, and for the ESS8 we were considering the 2.1 edition. That may suggest that more data will be added to this results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The questions in the survey are divided into specific topic groups:\n",
    "- Country\n",
    "- Weights\n",
    "- Media and social trust\n",
    "- Politics\n",
    "- Subjective well-being, social exclusion, religion, national and ethnic identity\n",
    "- Timing of life*\n",
    "- Gender, Year of birth and Household grid\n",
    "- Socio-demographics\n",
    "- Justice and Fairness*\n",
    "- Human values\n",
    "- Administrative variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The groups with asterisks, _Timing of life_ and _Justice and Fairness_, are exclusively prepared for the current edition of the survey. In the ESS8 the exclusive groups were _Climate change_ and _Welfare attitudes_. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The structure of the project is following:\n",
    "1. __data preparation__\n",
    "2. __exploratory data analysis__\n",
    "3. __statistical analysis__\n",
    "4. __machine learning__\n",
    "\n",
    "### The objective:\n",
    "The analysis of the differences between countries considered in the survey. The estimation of what factors have an influence on the happiness of the respondents and the prediction of the happiness factor of the test group."
